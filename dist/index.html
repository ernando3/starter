        On a turn, a player rolls the dice ðŸŽ² repeatedly. The goal is to
        accumulate as many points as possible, adding up (hold) the numbers
        rolled on the die ðŸŽ². However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn
        is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are
        forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous
        turns, just the total earned during that particular roll. A player has
        to choose to hold (stop rolling the die ðŸŽ²) if they do not want to take
        a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn.
        If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn
        are added to his or her score. When a player reaches a total of 100
        points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
